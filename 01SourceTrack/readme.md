After completing the environment setup in the project root directory, the following additional configurations are required to complete this task:

1. Create a Virtual Environment Named `myenv1`  
Use the following commands to create a virtual environment named `myenv1`. Ensure that Python version **3.9** is used.

```cmd
python -m venv myenv1
myenv1\Scripts\activate
pip install -r myenv1_python3.9.txt
```
2. Retrieve the Absolute Path of the Python Interpreter in myenv1
While inside the myenv1 environment, run the following command to get the absolute path of the Python interpreter:

```cmd
where python
```
Then, update line 166 of main.py with the retrieved path.

Context of main.py:
```PYTHON
    command = [
        r"E:\python3.9\myenv1\Scripts\python.exe",
        "decitiontree.py",
        *fastq_file
    ]
```

3. Configure myenv Script in main.py
Modify line 28 of main.py to include the script path for myenv.

Context of main.py:
```PYTHON
code_execution_config = LocalCommandLineCodeExecutor(
    timeout=60,
    work_dir="coding",
    virtual_env_context=SimpleNamespace(bin_path=r'E:\python\myenv\Scripts')
)
```
